  # Dear Developer,
  #
  #   As the CEO of Planetastic it is my pleasure to make you the lead developer
  #   on our product. I am very proud of all the work you are doing. I am about
  #   to get on a plane to see our investors. The last demo I did for them was
  #   good but they asked to see more features.
  #
  #   I realized we are going about this the wrong way. A flight having seats
  #   doesn't make any sense. Shouldn't a flight have a airplane and the
  #   airplane have many seats?
  #
  #   I took a CompSci class back in college so I threw together some code to
  #   help you out. I don't think THERE ARE BUGS. I used Microsoft Word as my
  #   editor.
  #
  #   Anyways, I wish I had time to finish this up but I have a presentation
  #   I need to finish for some upcoming Entrepreneur events.
  #
  #                                                 Sincerely,
  #                                                   Minimum Viable CEO
