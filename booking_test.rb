  #
  # Dear Planetastic Team,
  #
  #   It has been a pleasure being your CEO for these past 9 months. It is with
  #   a heavy heart that I am leaving the company. Tom, from our board of
  #   directors, is going to step in and be acting CEO until a suitable
  #   replacement is found.
  #
  #   Tom and I want to assure you that during this transition time that
  #   everything will continue smoothly. We still have our important demo
  #   to the Airline companies at the end of the week. Which should be no
  #   problem because we have our lead developer putting the final touches on
  #   the new booking features.
  #
  #   Let me thank you again for your effort supporting me. I wish you all the
  #   best on this and all your future projects. The sky is most definitely the
  #   limit for every single one of you.
  #
  #                                                 Sincerely,
  #                                                   Minimum Viable CEO
  #
  #   P.S. You can reach me, if you need anything, at ceo@campflix.com
